// In query 3, she has 500 units of money. She can either buy item 1 or item 4 ( 5 of each kind respectively). Thus, she has only 2 kinds of items to choose from.

// In query 5, she has 800 units of money. She can either buy item 1 or item 4 ( 8 of each kind respectively) or item 2(she can buy 4 of these) or item 3(2 of these). Thus, she has 4 kinds of items to choose from.
